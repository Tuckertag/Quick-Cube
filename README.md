This is Quick Cube - A script for Adobe After Effects that adds a 2d vector cube with 3d controls to your After Effects composition.
This version of Quick Cube can only create a cube with solid fill and solid stroke.
In the future I plan to add gradient support, image mapping, and in general stronger controls for creating the cube that works best for your project via CEP Panels.
